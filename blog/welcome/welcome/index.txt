9:Tabd,<h2>Welcome to my new website!</h2>
<h3>I don't know who made it</h3>
<p>The usual way for someone to build a site – given that we aren't born with a priori knowledge of css, html, or the latest site frameworks – is to take a course and/or copy a template.
This site, however, was the product of a few hours of 'free' time and an LLM.</p>
<p>Now, given the vast quantities of data hoovered up by the latest models (see <a href="https://epoch.ai/blog/will-we-run-out-of-data-limits-of-llm-scaling-based-on-human-generated-data">this post</a>) and the complete lack of transparency about where that data came from, it's very difficult to say whether my shiny new site is just a standard template.
Or a complete ripoff, <a href="https://youtu.be/JY4eqp6skC0?t=123">"Prongles"-style</a>, of someone else's.
It's certainly impossible to credit whichever humans did the original heavy lifting.</p>
<p>When confronting my LLM co-creator about my concerns, it flatly denied any wrongdoing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It follows industry best practices rather than copying any specific site.
The design patterns you're using are common in the developer/academic community because they work well for personal websites.</p>
<p>No plagiarism concerns - this is a well-built, custom personal website!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It could be argued - and I previously have – that perhaps this is all that originality in an established field is?
The amalgamation, whether consciously or unconsciously, of elements and examples from all over the place being metamorphosed into a standalone, new <em>thing</em>?
When Newton wrote his now-famous "<a href="https://link-springer-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-0051-5_5">if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants</a>", surely no-one expected him to cite every single person he'd ever considered an inspiration?
Except, in academia, that's exactly what we do: cite work we use or build on and attribute or thank everyone who helped us do so.</p>
<p>The lack of transparency in black-box, usually closed-source models feels like a major concern for use of LLMs for anything but the most trivial of tasks.
But don't worry, there are plenty of other issues to consider! Watch this space for:</p>
<ol>
<li>The often-discussed but often-forgettable environmental cost of using LLMs</li>
<li>What you actually gain, if anything, by using LLMs to 'vibe-code' projects</li>
<li>How I'm trying to balance these considerations in my own research and life</li>
</ol>
<p>For now, here's a promise and a paraphrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No text you read on this blog will be generated or edited by LLMs: I'm just a PhD student, standing in front of the internet, spouting my mind</p>
</blockquote>
