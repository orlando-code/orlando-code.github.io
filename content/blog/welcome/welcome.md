## Welcome to my new website!

### I don't know who made it

The usual way for someone to build a site, given that we aren't born with a priori knowledge of css, html, or the latest site frameworks, is to take a course, or copy a template and tiptoe around the edges.
This site, however, was the product of a few hours of 'free' time and an LLM.

Now, given the vast quantities of data hoovered up by the latest models (see [this post](https://epoch.ai/blog/will-we-run-out-of-data-limits-of-llm-scaling-based-on-human-generated-data)) and the complete lack of transparency about where that data came from, it's very difficult to say whether my shiny new site is just a standard template. Or a complete ripoff, ["Prongles"-style](https://youtu.be/JY4eqp6skC0?t=123), of someone else's. It's certainly impossible to credit whichever humans did the original heavy lifting.

When confronting my LLM co-creator about my concerns, it flatly denied any wrongdoing:

> It follows industry best practices rather than copying any specific site. 
> The design patterns you're using are common in the developer/academic community because they work well for personal websites.
>
> No plagiarism concerns - this is a well-built, custom personal website!


It could be argued - and I previously have â€“ that perhaps this is all that originality in an established field is? The amalgamation, whether consciously or unconsciously, of elements and examples from all over the place being metamorphosed into a standalone, new *thing*? When Newton wrote his now-famous "[if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants](https://link-springer-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-0051-5_5)", surely no-one expected him to cite every single person he'd ever considered an inspiration? Except, in academia, that's exactly what we do: cite work we use or build on and attribute or thank everyone who helped us do so.

The lack of transparency in black-box, usually closed-source models feels like a major concern for use of LLMs for anything but the most trivial of tasks. But there are plenty of other issues to consider! Watch this space for:

1. The often-forgettable but often-discussed environmental cost of using LLMs
2. What you actually gain, if anything, from using LLMs to 'vibe-code' projects
3. How I'm trying to balance these considerations in my own research

For now, here's a promise:
> No text you read on this blog will be generated or edited by LLMs: I'm just a PhD student, standing in front of the internet, spouting my mind
